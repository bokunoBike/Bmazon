The world puts off its mask of vastness to its lover.
It becomes small as one song, as one kiss of the eternal.
大千世界在情人面前解开裤裆
绵长如舌吻
纤细如诗行

You smiled and talked to me of nothing and I felt that for this I had been waiting long.
你对我微笑不语
为这句我等了几个世纪

Dear friend, I feel the silence of your great thoughts of many a deepening eventide on this beach when I listen to these waves.
听潮
黄昏渐消
我想我听懂了你伟大思想的寂寥

The song feels the infinite in the air, the picture in the earth, the poem in the air and the earth；
For its words have meaning that walks and music that soars.
歌无极
在空气里
画无极
在大地上
诗无极
在空气和大地
诗的字句里
有能流传的意义
有能翱翔的乐音                                 --此文字指本书的不再付印或绝版版本。
